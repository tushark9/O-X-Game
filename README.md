# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

This is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os. It is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbol (either "O" or "X"). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.
